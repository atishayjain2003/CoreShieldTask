# CoreShieldTask
1. This repository is for the first assignment of Coreshield Technologies. 
Assignment Details :
Develop a web application that utilizes OpenStreetMap to provide the following
functionalities:
1. Real-Time Routing: Calculate and display the estimated travel time and directions from
a moving point (e.g., a rider's current location) to a static destination point.
2. Closed Ares Definition: Allow users to define a closed area on the map by clicking to
create shapes such as triangles, polygons, etc.
3. Technical Stack : As per your preference.


My approach and learning:
1. Learned about OpenStreetMap through google, chatgpt and documentation. 
2. Went through a quick tutorial to understand the use cases and working and it was damn helpful
3. Added simple features with the help of documentation and chat gpt
4. PS: I now realise the value of documentation even more 
5. I started with adding the figure functionality first but towards the later part had to use chat gpt extensively to develop the routes mechanism and deliver estimated time of arrival 

How to run the project
1. Clone the repo and install and activate virtual environment through commands "virtualenv env" and "env/scripts/activate"
2. Install the dependencies 
3. Go to the project directory and run the command "python manage.py runserver"
